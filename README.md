# Kidney Therapeutic Simulation Platform

A comprehensive Python + HTML-based simulation platform for designing, analyzing, and visualizing kidney-targeted protein therapy using engineered proteins, nanoparticles, and hydrogels. The system models drug pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety with interactive and animated visualizations.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

* `kidney_pharmacokinetics_simulations.py`

  > Full Python backend engine for generating figures and analysis using matplotlib + NumPy + SciPy.

* `kidney_simulation.html`

  > Interactive frontend with sliders, plots (Plotly.js), and simulation logic in JavaScript.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Option 1: Run Python Backend

1. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

2. Run the simulation:

```bash
python kidney_pharmacokinetics_simulations.py
```

This will generate all plots, summary report, and optionally perform sensitivity/dose-response analysis.

### Option 2: Use the Interactive HTML

1. Open `kidney_simulation.html` in a modern browser.
2. Adjust dosage, kinetics, disease severity, and observe dynamic GFR/fibrosis outcomes.

> Great for interactive education, demo, or preliminary design testing!
